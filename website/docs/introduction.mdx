# ComposeDB Docs

ComposeDB is a composable graph database built on [Ceramic](https://ceramic.network), designed for Web3 applications. 

### Use Cases
| Use Case  | Examples  |
|---|---|
|__Decentralized identity__| `user profiles` `credentials` `reputation systems` |
|__Web3 social__| `social graphs` `posts` `reactions` `comments` `messages` |
|__DAO tools__| `proposals` `projects` `tasks` `votes` `contribution graphs` |
|__Open information graphs__| `DeSci graphs` `knowledge graphs` `discourse graphs` |

### Why ComposeDB?

-  Store and query data with powerful, easy-to-use GraphQL APIs
-  Build faster with a catalog of plug-and-play schemas
-  Bootstrap content by plugging into a composable data ecosystem
-  Deliver great UX with sign-in with Ethereum, Solana, and more
-  Eliminate trust and guarantee data verifiability
-  Scale your Web3 data infrastructure beyond L1 or L2 blockchains

### Project Status: `Beta`

ComposeDB officially entered `Beta` on February 28, 2023. With Beta, you can now build and deploy apps to production on mainnet! All of ComposeDB's core features are available for you to use including GraphQL APIs, reusable models, and full data composability. However, at this time we are not yet guaranteeing a 100% stable, bug-free platform. Great Web3 protocols take time to harden and mature. Thank you for being a ComposeDB pioneer.
