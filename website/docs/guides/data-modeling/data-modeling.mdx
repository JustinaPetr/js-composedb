# Data Modeling

Learn how to model data for ComposeDB.

## Introduction
Models and composites are the core building blocks for ComposeDB applications.

### Models

A **model** is the GraphQL schema for a single piece of data (e.g. social post) including its relations to other models and accounts. Models are designed to be plug-and-play so they can easily be reused by developers; when multiple apps use the same model, they share the same underlying data set. To be usable in your ComposeDB app, you need to bundle one or more models into a composite.

```graphql
# Example Model that stores a display name

type DisplayName @createModel(accountRelation: SINGLE, description: "Display name for a user") {
  displayName: String! @string(minLength: 3, maxLength: 50)
}
```

### Composites

A **composite** is a group of one or more models that defines the complete graph data schema for your app. Composites are used on both the ComposeDB server and the client.


## Get Started

### Model catalog

Discover reusable, plug-and-play models in the [Model Catalog](Data%20Modeling%202599a8a3f4bd47d29c4898780a80f9cd/Model%20Catalog%20e2eddcca410f4a19b533fdccd7c5c6a0.md). 

### Writing models

Jump into the [Writing Models](Data%20Modeling%202599a8a3f4bd47d29c4898780a80f9cd/Writing%20Models%20e829e0e595574a0d90987f9acdc011f0.md) guides to begin writing your own models.

### Composites

Convert your models into a [Composites](Data%20Modeling%202599a8a3f4bd47d29c4898780a80f9cd/Composites%20d92f5986e2594ada841586efb21bb5a4.md) for use by your application.
